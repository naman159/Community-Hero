# Community_Hero
A community event manager app where people can collaborate on making social events for the greater good successful. 
Users can participate in the events organized by other users or the events handpicked by the admins based on their proximity. Feel that there is not enough social good in this world? Make your own events and have other users participate in them. 
The app features user portfolio which records all the events in which the user participated and generates a 'Social Welfare' score based on their participation. The primary purpose of this app would be to validate the social work done by the users as claimed by them and to maintain a file of their voluntary work in one place. The API for this app can be connected with other third party systems like Collegeboard, commonapp.org and Linkedin. Community Hero is the one stop destination for making voluntary social work more credible, practical and efficient. 

Community Hero is a native Android App written in Java.
